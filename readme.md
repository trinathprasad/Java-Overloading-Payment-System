# ðŸ’³ Java Overloading Payment System

This is a simple Java console-based application that simulates a real-world payment process using **method overloading** and **object-oriented principles** like **encapsulation**.

It demonstrates how to handle payments via **Cash**, **Credit Card**, and **Debit Card**, with input validation and masking sensitive card information.
